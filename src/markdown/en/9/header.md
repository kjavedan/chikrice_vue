**We recommend having 4 to 5 meals a day for several reasons:**

**Stable Energy Levels:** Eating smaller, more frequent meals helps maintain steady blood sugar levels throughout the day, reducing energy dips and cravings.

**Improved Metabolism:** Regular eating can support a healthy metabolism by keeping it active throughout the day, potentially aiding in weight management.

**Optimal Nutrient Absorption:** Spreading meals throughout the day allows for better absorption of nutrients, ensuring your body gets the essential vitamins, minerals, and energy it needs.

**Controlled Appetite:** Eating more frequently can help prevent overeating at main meals and reduce the likelihood of unhealthy snacking.

**Sustained Muscle Repair:** For those involved in fitness or muscle-building activities, regular meals support ongoing muscle repair and recovery after exercise.
