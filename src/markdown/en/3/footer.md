Based on the information you provide, we calculate your daily calorie needs and adjust them to align with your desired goalâ€”whether it's weight loss, weight gain, or maintenance. Here's how we do it:

1. **Calorie Adjustment**:
    - For weight loss, we reduce your daily calorie intake by a set amount.
    - For weight gain, we increase your daily calorie intake.
    - For maintenance, we keep your calorie intake consistent with your current needs.

2. **Daily Macros Calculation**:
    - We break down your adjusted calorie intake into macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).
    - This ensures you get a balanced diet that supports your goal.

3. **Customized Meal Plan**:
    - We design a meal plan that specifies what and how much you should eat each day.
    - The plan includes a variety of foods to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients.

By following this method, we help you achieve your goal in a healthy and sustainable way, ensuring you get the right amount of calories and nutrients every day.
