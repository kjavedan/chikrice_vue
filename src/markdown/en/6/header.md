Nutrient Density: Choose carbohydrates that provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber, such as oats, sweet potatoes, and beans/lentils.

Timing and Usage: Plan to include carbs like oats for your first meal and options like rice or pasta later in the day, preferably after your workout to replenish muscle glycogen.

Complex vs. Simple Carbs: Opt for complex carbohydrates like oats, beans/lentils, and whole grains (rice, pasta) over simple carbs (bread, white rice) for sustained energy and blood sugar control.

Fiber Content: Select options high in fiber, such as oats, whole grains, and beans/lentils, to support digestion and feelings of fullness.

Glycemic Index: Aim for carbohydrates with a lower glycemic index (oats, sweet potatoes, beans/lentils) to avoid rapid spikes in blood sugar levels.

Personal Preference: Consider taste preferences and culinary versatility when choosing between options like rice, pasta, bread, and potatoes.

This approach ensures that your carbohydrate intake supports your energy needs throughout the day and optimizes recovery after exercise.
