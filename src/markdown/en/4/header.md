Imagine your body is like a car, and just like a car needs fuel to run, our bodies need food to give us energy and help us grow. There are three main types of food that give us energy:

**Carbohydrates**: These are like the fuel that makes the car go fast. They are in foods like bread, rice, and pasta. They give us quick energy to play and do our daily activities.

**Proteins**: Proteins are like the builders that help us grow strong muscles and repair our bodies when we get hurt. They are in foods like chicken, fish, and beans.

**Fats**: Fats are like the oil that keeps the car engine running smoothly. They give us energy too, and they help our bodies absorb important vitamins. Fats are in foods like butter, nuts, and avocados.

So, just like cars need the right kind of fuel to work well, our bodies need a mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to stay healthy, grow strong, and have lots of energy.
