Think of macros as the building blocks for your body, just like bricks for a house.
- **Carbohydrates** are like quick energy for running and playing.
- **Proteins** are like builders that help you grow muscles and stay strong.
- **Fats** are like helpers that give you energy for a long time and keep everything working smoothly.

We calculate macros to make sure we eat enough of each one to achieve our goal. For example, if you want to build muscles, you eat more protein. If you want to lose fat, you might eat fewer carbs. It's like making sure you have enough of each kind of brick to build the best house (or body!) possible.
